**NOTE**
gRPC is a modern, open-source, high-performance RPC framework that can run in any environment. It can efficiently connect services in and across data centers with pluggable support for load balancing, tracing, health-checking, and authentication. It is also applicable in the last mile of distributed computing to connect devices, mobile applications, and browsers to backend services. You can find documentation on gRPCâ€™s official website and get support from open source communities. This guide points you to solutions for building Android apps using gRPC.
